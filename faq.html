		<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>
		<p>Q. Does my software have to support OSC in order to use libmapper?<br />
       A. No - libmapper provides its own OSC interface through a dependency on liblo, so your device/program doesn't need separate OSC support.</p>

    <p>Q. My software already supports OSC - isn't it overkill to add another OSC-based interface?<br />
       A. Remember that libmapper signals are only sent over the network when they have been connected to a destination - libmapper effectively throttles the signals before they hit the network. This means that adding calls to the libmapper signal update function will consume only minimal resources (and no network bandwidth) unless the libmapper functionality is actually being used for mapping.</p>

    <p>Q. Why are my libmapper devices not showing up on my Windows machine?<br />
       A. Windows Firewall may block libmapper's OSC multicast messages when on a Public network, which can be avoided by either marking any of your Public networks as Private with the 'Network profile' property or by turning off the firewall completely (at your own risk).
