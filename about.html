		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>Open Sound Control (OSC) has been adopted by the academic and experimental-music communities for interactive media programming due to its flexibility in representing control data, strong semantics/human-readability, precise time-tagging, etc. Unfortunately, different projects utilizing OSC are rarely protocol-compatible. Many proposals have been made for creating standardized address-spaces/schemas to enable intercommunication, but we believe this is the wrong approach since it destroys the most powerful and useful aspect of OSC – the flexibility it allows for each user/designer/programmer to represent control signals and structures according to their specific needs or desires.</p>
		<p>libmapper takes a different approach: instead of enforcing preset schemas we provide simple, distributed discovery and description; instead of address standardization we provide automatic translation; instead of normalization we provide automatic scaling... but that’s not all!</p>
		<p>In addition to the flexibility of data-representation provided by Open Sound Control, libmapper provides:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>automatic negotiation for resources (e.g. ports, unique names)</li>
          <li>automatic peer discovery</li>
          <li>a semantic abstraction of the networking layer (make connections between devices and signals by name rather than having to manually set namespaces/IP addresses/ports</li>
          <li>description, including extensible properties as key-value pairs</li>
          <li>automatic translation of OSC addresses between peers</li>
          <li>automatic type coercion &amp; linear scaling between peers</li>
          <li>arbitrary signal processing within connections, including FIR and IIR filtering</li>
          <li>remote connection management for persistence, automatic recovery, session management, saving and loading mapping configurations</li>
          <li>the ability to query or stream the current value of remote destinations, enabling the use of supervised machine learning techniques for mapping</li>
          <li>a powerful abstraction of signal “instances”, supporting arbitrary interconnection of polyphonic media synthesizers, multitouch interfaces, tangible interfaces, computer-vision blob-tracking algorithms, etc</li>
        </ul>

        <p>libmapper creates a distributed mapping system/network, with no central points of failure, the potential for tight collaboration and easy parallelization of media synthesis.</p>
