<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Since <em>libmapper</em> uses GNU autoconf, getting started with the library
is the same as any other library on Linux; use <code>./configure</code> and then
<code>make</code> to compile it.  You'll need <code>swig</code> available if you want to
compile the Python bindings.  On Mac OS X, we provide a precompiled
Framework bundle for 32- and 64-bit Intel platforms, so using it with
XCode should be a matter of including it in your project.</p>

<h3>Overview of the API organization</h3>

<p>If you take a look at the API documentation, there is a section called
"modules".  This is divided into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="api/group__signals.html">Signals</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__devices.html">Devices</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__admins.html">Admins</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__devicedb.html">Device database</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__signaldb.html">Signal database</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__linkdb.html">Links database</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__connectiondb.html">Connections database</a></li>
  <li><a href="api/group__monitor.html">Monitors</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For this tutorial, the only sections to pay attention to are Devices
and Signals.  Admins is reserved for providing custom networking
configurations, but in general you don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>Monitor and the various database modules are used to keep track of
what devices, signals and connections are on the network.  Devices do
not need to worry about this.  It is used mainly for creating user
interfaces for mapping design and will also not be covered here.</p>

<p>Functions and types from each module are prefixed with
<code>mapper_&lt;module&gt;_</code>, in order to avoid namespace clashing.  However,
since this is a bit verbose, it is shortened to <code>mdev_</code> and <code>msig</code> for
device and signal functions respectively.</p>

<h3>Devices</h3>

<h4>Creating a device</h4>

<p>To create a <em>libmapper</em> device, it is necessary to provide a few
parameters to <code>mdev_new</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_device mdev_new( const char *name_prefix,
                        int initial_port,
                        mapper_admin admin )
</code></pre>

<p>Every device on the network needs a name and port.  In fact the
requested name and port are only "starting values".  There is an
initialization period after a device is created where a unique ordinal
is chosen to append to the device name.  This allows multiple devices
with the same name to exist on the network.</p>

<p>Similarly, each device gets a unique port to use for exchanging signal
data.  The provided port number is the "starting port", but the
allocation algorithm will possibly choose another port number close to
it if someone else on the network is already using it.  We usually use
a port number of 9000, and let the system decide if this is
appropriate.^[Strictly this is only necessary for devices on the same
computer, but port numbers are in abundance so we just allocate one
per device to keep things consistant.]</p>

<p>The third parameter of mdev_new is an optional admin instance.  It is
not necessary to provide this, but can be used to specify different
networking parameters, such as specifying the name of the network
interface to use.</p>

<p>An example of creating a device:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_device my_device = mdev_new("test", 9000, 0);
</code></pre>

<h4>Polling the device</h4>

<p>The device lifecycle looks like this, in terrible ASCII diagram art:</p>

<pre><code>mdev_new -&gt; mdev_poll +-&gt; mdev_free
              |       |
              +----&lt;--+
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, after a device is created, it must be continuously
polled during its lifetime, and then explicitly freed when it is no
longer needed.</p>

<p>The polling is necessary for several reasons: to respond to requests
on the admin bus; to check for incoming signals; to update outgoing
signals.  Therefore even a device that does not have signals must be
polled.  The user program must organize to have a timer or idle
handler which can poll the device often enough.  Polling interval is
not extremely sensitive, but should be at least 100 ms or less.  The
faster it is polled, the faster it can handle incoming and outgoing
signals.</p>

<p>The <code>mdev_poll</code> function can be blocking or non-blocking, depending on
how you want your application to behave.  It takes a number of
milliseconds during which it should do some work, or 0 if it should
check for any immediate actions and then return without waiting:</p>

<pre><code>int mdev_poll( mapper_device md,
               int block_ms )
</code></pre>

<p>An example of calling it with non-blocking behaviour:</p>

<pre><code>mdev_poll( my_device, 0 );
</code></pre>

<p>If your polling is in the middle of a processing function or in
response to a GUI event for example, non-blocking behaviour is
desired.  On the other hand if you put it in the middle of a loop
which reads incoming data at intervals or steps through a simulation
for example, you can use <code>mdev_poll</code> as your "sleep" function, so that
it will react to network activity while waiting.</p>

<p>It returns the number of messages handled, so optionally you could
continue to call it until there are no more messages waiting.  Of
course, you should be careful doing that without limiting the time it
will loop for, since if the incoming stream is fast enough you might
never get anything else done!</p>

<p>Note that an important difference between blocking and non-blocking
polling is that during the blocking period, messages will be handled
immediately as they are received.  On the other hand, if you use your
own sleep, messages will be queued up until you can call poll();
stated differently, it will "time-quantize" the message handling.
This is not necessarily bad, but you should be aware of this effect.</p>

<p>Since there is a delay before the device is completely initialized, it
is sometimes useful to be able to determine this using <code>mdev_ready</code>.
Only when <code>mdev_ready</code> returns non-zero is it valid to use the
device's name.</p>

<h4>Freeing the device</h4>

<p>It is necessary to explicitly free the device at the end of your
program.  This not only frees memory, but also sends some messages to
"politely" remove itself from the network.</p>

<p>An example of freeing a device:</p>

<pre><code>mdev_free( my_device );
</code></pre>

<h3>Signals</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to create a device, poll it, and free it, we only
need to know how to add signals in order to give our program some
input/output functionality.</p>

<p>We'll start with creating a "sender", so we will first talk about how
to update output signals.</p>

<h4>Creating a signal</h4>

<p>A signal requires a bit more information than a device, much of which
is optional:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_signal mdev_add_input( const char *name,
                              int length,
                              char type,
                              const char *unit,
                              void *minimum,
                              void *maximum,
                              mapper_signal_handler *handler,
                              void *user_data )

mapper_signal mdev_add_output( const char *name,
                               int length,
                               char type,
                               const char *unit,
                               void *minimum,
                               void *maximum )
</code></pre>

<p>The only <em>required</em> parameters here are the signal "length", its name,
and data type.  Signals are assumed to be vectors of values, so for
usual single-valued signals, a length of 1 should be specified.  A
signal name should start with "/", as this is how it is represented in
the OSC address.  (One will be added if you forget to do this.)
Finally, supported types are currently 'i' or 'f' (specified as
characters in C, not strings), for <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> values,
respectively.</p>

<p>The other parameters are not strictly required, but the more
information you provide, the more the mapper can do some things
automatically.  For example, if <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> are provided,
it will be possible to create linear-scaled connections very quickly.
If <code>unit</code> is provided, the mapper will be able to similarly figure out
a linear scaling based on unit conversion. (Centimeters to inches for
example.)^[Currently automatic unit-based scaling is not a supported
feature, but will be added in the future.  You can take advantage of
this future development by simply providing unit information whenever
it is available.  It is also helpful documentation for users.]</p>

<p>Notice that optional values are provided as <code>void*</code> pointers.  This is
because a signal can either be <code>float</code> or <code>int</code>, and your maximum and
minimum values should correspond in type.  So you should pass in a
<code>float*</code> or <code>int*</code> by taking the address of a local variable.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is usually necessary to be informed when input signal
values change.  This is done by providing a function to be called
whenever its value is modified by an incoming message.  It is passed
in the <code>handler</code> parameter, with context information to be passed to
that function during callback in <code>user_data</code>.</p>

<p>An example of creating a "barebones" <code>int</code> scalar output signal with
no unit, minimum, or maximum information:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_signal outputA = mdev_add_output( dev, "/outA", 1, 'i', 0, 0, 0 );
</code></pre>

<p>An example of a <code>float</code> signal where some more information is provided:</p>

<pre><code>float minimum = 0.0f;
float maximum = 5.0f;
mapper_signal sensor1_voltage = mdev_add_output( dev, "/sensor1", 1, 'f',
                                                 "V", &amp;minimum, &amp;maximum );
</code></pre>

<p>So far we know how to create a device and to specify an output signal
for it.  To recap, let's review the code so far:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_device my_sender = mdev_new("test_sender", 9000, 0);
mapper_signal sensor1_voltage = mdev_add_output( my_sender, "/sensor1",
                                                 1, 'f', "V",
                                                 &amp;minimum, &amp;maximum )

while (!done) {
    mdev_poll(my_sender, 50);
    ... do stuff ...
    ... update signals ...
}

mdev_free(my_sender);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that although you have a pointer to the mapper_signal structure,
which was retuned by <code>mdev_add_output</code>, its memory "owned" by the
device.  In other words, you should not worry about freeing its
memory--this will happen automatically when the device is destroyed.
It is possible to retrieve a device's inputs or outputs by name or by
index at a later time using the functions
<code>mdev_get_&lt;input/output&gt;_by_&lt;name/index&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4>Updating signals</h4>

<p>We can imagine the above program getting sensor information in a loop.
It could be running on an network-enable ARM device and reading the
ADC register directly, or it could be running on a computer and
reading data from an Arduino over a USB serial port, or it could just
be a mouse-controlled GUI slider.  However it's getting the data, it
must provide it to <em>libmapper</em> so that it will be sent to other
devices if that signal is mapped.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by the <code>msig_update</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>void msig_update( mapper_signal sig, void *value )
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, a <code>void*</code> pointer must be provided.  This must point
to a data structure identified by the signal's <code>length</code> and <code>type</code>.
In other words, if the signal is a 10-vector of <code>int</code>, then <code>value</code>
should point to the first item in a C array of 10 <code>int</code>s.  If it is a
scalar <code>float</code>, it should be provided with the address of a <code>float</code>
variable.</p>

<p>A short-hand is provided for scalar signals of particular types:</p>

<pre><code>void msig_update_int( mapper_signal sig, int value )

void msig_update_float( mapper_signal sig, float value )
</code></pre>

<p>So in the "sensor 1 voltage" example, assuming in "do stuff" we have
some code which reads sensor 1's value into a float variable called
<code>v1</code>, the loop becomes:</p>

<pre><code>while (!done) {
    mdev_poll(my_device, 50);
    float v1 = read_sensor_1();
    msig_update_float( sensor1_voltage, v1 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is about all that is needed to expose sensor 1's voltage to the
network as a mappable parameter.  The <em>libmapper</em> GUI can now map this
value to a receiver, where it could control a synthesizer parameter or
change the brightness of an LED, or whatever else you want to do.</p>

<h4>Signal conditioning</h4>

<p>Most synthesizers of course will not know what to do with
"voltage"--it is an electrical property that has nothing to do with
sound or music.  This is where <em>libmapper</em> really becomes useful.</p>

<p>Scaling or other signal conditioning can be taken care of <em>before</em>
exposing the signal, or it can be performed as part of the mapping.
Since the end user can demand any mathematical operation be performed
on the signal, he can perform whatever mappings between signals as he
wishes.</p>

<p>As a developer, it is therefore your job to provide information that
will be useful to the end user.</p>

<p>For example, if sensor 1 is a position sensor, instead of publishing
"voltage", you could convert it to centimeters or meters based on the
known dimensions of the sensor, and publish a "/sensor1/position"
signal instead, providing the unit information as well.</p>

<p>We call such signals "semantic", because they provide information with
more meaning than a relatively uninformative value based on the
electrical properties of the sensing technqiue.  Some sensors can
benefit from low-pass filtering or other measures to reduce noise.
Some sensors may need to be combined in order to derive physical
meaning.  What you choose to expose as outputs of your device is
entirely application-dependent.</p>

<p>You can even publish both "/sensor1/position" and "/sensor1/voltage"
if desired, in order to expose both processed and raw data.  Keep in
mind that these will not take up significant processing time, and
<em>zero</em> network bandwidth, if they are not mapped.</p>

<h4>Receiving signals</h4>

<p>Now that we know how to create a sender, it would be useful to also
know how to receive signals, so that we can create a sender-receiver
pair to test out the provided mapping functionality.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <code>mdev_add_input</code> function takes an optional
<code>handler</code> and <code>user_data</code>.  This is a function that will be called
whenever the value of that signal changes.  To create a receiver for a
synthesizer parameter "pulse width" (given as a ratio between 0 and
1), specify a handler when calling <code>mdev_add_input</code>.  We'll imagine
there is some C++ synthesizer implemented as a class <code>Synthesizer</code>
which has functions <code>setPulseWidth()</code> which sets the pulse width in a
thread-safe manner, and <code>startAudioInBackground()</code> which sets up the
audio thread.</p>

<p>Create the handler function, which is fairly simple,</p>

<pre><code>void pulsewidth_handler ( mapper_signal msig,
                          mapper_db_signal props,
                          int instance_id,
                          void *value,
                          int count,
                          mapper_timetag_t *tt )
{
    Synthesizer *s = (Synthesizer*) props-&gt;user_data;
    s-&gt;setPulseWidth( *(float*)v );
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, the pointer to the <code>Synthesizer</code> instance is extracted from the
<code>user_data</code> pointer, then it is dereferenced to set the pulse width
according to the value pointed to by <code>v</code>.</p>

<p>Then <code>main()</code> will look like,</p>

<pre><code>void main()
{
    Synthesizer synth;
    synth.startAudioInBackground();

    float min_pw = 0.0f;
    float max_pw = 1.0f;

    mapper_device my_receiver = mdev_new( "test_receiver", 9000, 0 );

    mapper_signal synth_pulsewidth =
        mdev_add_input( my_receiver, "/synth/pulsewidth",
                        1, 'f', 0, &amp;min_pw, &amp;max_pw,
                        pulsewidth_handler, &amp;synth );

    while ( !done )
        mdev_poll( my_receiver, 50 );

    mdev_free(my_receiver);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Publishing metadata</h3>

<p>Things like device names, signal units, and ranges, are examples of
metadata--information about the data you are exposing on the network.</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides the ability to specify arbitrary extra
metadata in the form of name-value pairs.  These are not interpreted
by <em>libmapper</em> in any way, but can be retrieved over the network.
This can be used for instance to give a device X and Y information, or
to perhaps give a signal some property like "reliability", or some
category like "light", "motor", "shaker", etc.</p>

<p>Some GUI implementing a Monitor could then use this information to
display information about the network in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>Any time there may be extra knowledge about a signal or device, it is
a good idea to represent it by adding such properties, which can be of
any OSC-compatible type.  (So, numbers and strings, etc.)</p>

<p>The property interface is through the functions,</p>

<pre><code>void mdev_set_property( mapper_device dev,
                        const char *property,
                        lo_type type,
                        lo_arg *value );

void msig_set_property( mapper_signal sig,
                        const char *property,
                        lo_type type,
                        lo_arg *value );
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <em>libmapper</em> reuses the <code>lo_arg</code> union from the <em>liblo</em>
OSC library, which can be used to hold any OSC-compatible value.  The
type of the <code>value</code> argument is specified by <code>type</code>, and can be any
<code>lo_type</code> value; floats are <code>'f'</code> or <code>LO_FLOAT</code>, 32-bit integers are
<code>'i'</code> or <code>LO_INT32</code>, and strings are <code>'s'</code> or <code>LO_STRING</code>, but you
should consult the <em>liblo</em> documentation for more information.</p>

<p>For example, to store a <code>float</code> indicating the X position of a device,
you can call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>lo_arg x;
x.f = 12.5;
mdev_set_property( my_device, "x", 'f', &amp;x);
</code></pre>

<p>In practice it is safe to cast to <code>lo_arg*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>float x = 12.5;
mdev_set_property( my_device, "x", 'f', (lo_arg*)&amp;x);
</code></pre>

<p>To specify strings, it is necessary to perform such a cast, since the
<code>lo_arg*</code> you provide should actually point to the beginning of the
string:</p>

<pre><code>char *sensingMethod = "resistive";
msig_set_property( sensor1, "sensingMethod",
                   's', (lo_arg*)sensingMethod);
</code></pre>

<p>In general you can use any property name not already in use by the
device or signal data structure.  Reserved words for signals are:</p>

<pre><code>device_name, direction, length, max, min, name, type, unit, user_data;
</code></pre>

<p>for devices, they are:</p>

<pre><code>host, port, name, user_data.
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you query or set signal properties using these
keywords, you will get or modify the same information that is
available directly from the <code>mapper_db_signal</code> data structure.
Therefore this can provide a unified string-based method for accessing
any signal property:</p>

<pre><code>mapper_db_signal *props = msig_properties( sensor1 );
lo_type type;
const lo_arg *value;
mapper_db_signal_property_lookup( props, "sensingMethod", &amp;type, &amp;value );
</code></pre>

<p>Primarily this is an interface meant for network monitors, but may
come in useful for an application implementing a device.</p>
