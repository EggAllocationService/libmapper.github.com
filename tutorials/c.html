<h1>Getting started with libmapper</h1>

<p>Since <em>libmapper</em> uses GNU autoconf, getting started with the library is the
same as any other library on Linux; use <code>./configure</code> and then <code>make</code> to compile
it.  You'll need <code>swig</code> available if you want to compile the Python bindings.
On Mac OS X, we provide a precompiled Framework bundle for 32- and 64-bit Intel
platforms, so using it with XCode should be a matter of including it in your
project.</p>

<h2>Overview of the API structure</h2>

<p>If you take a look at the API documentation, there is a section called
"modules".  This is divided into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../api/group__networks.html">Networks</a></li>
    <li><a href="../api/group__devices.html">Devices</a></li>
    <li><a href="../api/group__signals.html">Signals</a></li>
    <li><a href="../api/group__maps.html">Maps</a></li>
    <li><a href="../api/group__slots.html">Slots</a></li>
    <li><a href="../api/group__databases.html">Databases</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For this tutorial, the only sections to pay attention to are <strong>Devices</strong> and
<strong>Signals</strong>.  <strong>Networks</strong> are reserved for providing custom networking
configurations, but in general you don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Database</strong> module is used to keep track of what devices, signals and maps
are on the network.  It is used mainly for creating user interfaces for mapping
design and will also not be covered here.</p>

<p>Functions and types from each module are prefixed with <code>mapper_&lt;module&gt;_</code>, in
order to avoid namespace clashing.</p>

<h2>Devices</h2>

<h3>Creating a device</h3>

<p>To create a <em>libmapper</em> device, it is necessary to provide a few parameters to
<code>mapper_device_new</code>:</p>

<pre>mapper_device mapper_device_new(const char *name_prefix,
                                int initial_port,
                                mapper_network network);
</pre>

<p>Every device on the network needs a name and port.  In fact the requested name
and port are only "starting values".  There is an initialization period after a
device is created where a unique ordinal is chosen to append to the device name.
This allows multiple devices with the same name to exist on the network.</p>

<p>Similarly, each device gets a unique port to use for exchanging signal data.
The provided port number is the "starting port", but the allocation algorithm
will possibly choose another port number close to it if someone else on the
network is already using it.  We usually use a port number of 9000, and let the
system decide if this is appropriate.^[Strictly this is only necessary for
devices on the same computer, but port numbers are in abundance so we just
allocate one per device to keep things consistent.]</p>

<p>The third parameter of mapper_device_new is an optional network instance.
It is not necessary to provide this, but can be used to specify different
networking parameters, such as specifying the name of the network interface
to use.</p>

<p>An example of creating a device:</p>

<pre>mapper_device my_device = mapper_device_new("test", 0, 0);</pre>

<h3>Polling the device</h3>

<p>The device lifecycle looks like this, in terrible ASCII diagram art:</p>

<pre>mapper_device_new -&gt; mapper_device_poll +-&gt; mapper_device_free
                        |               |
                        +-------&lt;-------+
</pre>

<p>In other words, after a device is created, it must be continuously polled during
its lifetime, and then explicitly freed when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>The polling is necessary for several reasons: to respond to requests on the
admin bus; to check for incoming signals; to update outgoing signals.  Therefore
even a device that does not have signals must be polled.  The user program must
organize to have a timer or idle handler which can poll the device often enough.
Polling interval is not extremely sensitive, but should be at least 100 ms or
less.  The faster it is polled, the faster it can handle incoming and outgoing
signals.</p>

<p>The <code>mapper_device_poll</code> function can be blocking or non-blocking, depending on
how you want your application to behave.  It takes a number of milliseconds
during which it should do some work, or 0 if it should check for any immediate
actions and then return without waiting:</p>

<pre>int mapper_device_poll(mapper_device dev, int block_ms);</pre>

<p>An example of calling it with non-blocking behaviour:</p>

<pre>mapper_device_poll(my_device, 0);</pre>

<p>If your polling is in the middle of a processing function or in response to a
GUI event for example, non-blocking behaviour is desired.  On the other hand if
you put it in the middle of a loop which reads incoming data at intervals or
steps through a simulation for example, you can use <code>mapper_device_poll</code> as your
"sleep" function, so that it will react to network activity while waiting.</p>

<p>It returns the number of messages handled, so optionally you could continue to
call it until there are no more messages waiting.  Of course, you should be
careful doing that without limiting the time it will loop for, since if the
incoming stream is fast enough you might never get anything else done!</p>

<p>Note that an important difference between blocking and non-blocking polling is
that during the blocking period, messages will be handled immediately as they
are received.  On the other hand, if you use your own sleep, messages will be
queued up until you can call poll(); stated differently, it will "time-quantize"
the message handling.  This is not necessarily bad, but you should be aware of
this effect.</p>

<p>Since there is a delay before the device is completely initialized, it is
sometimes useful to be able to determine this using <code>mapper_device_ready</code>.
Only when <code>mapper_device_ready</code> returns non-zero is it valid to use the device's
name.</p>

<h3>Freeing the device</h3>

<p>It is necessary to explicitly free the device at the end of your program.  This
not only frees memory, but also sends some messages to "politely" remove itself
from the network.</p>

<p>An example of freeing a device:</p>

<pre>mapper_device_free(my_device);</pre>

<h2>Signals</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to create a device, poll it, and free it, we only need to
know how to add signals in order to give our program some input/output
functionality.  While libmapper enables arbitrary connections between <em>any</em>
declared signals, we still find it helpful to distinguish between two type of
signals: <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>outputs</code> signals are <em>sources</em> of data, updated locally by their parent
        device</li>
    <li><code>inputs</code> signals are <em>consumers</em> of data and are <strong>not</strong> generally updated
        locally by their parent device.</li>
</ul>


<p>This can become a bit confusing, since the "reverb" parameter of a sound
synthesizer might be updated locally through user interaction with a GUI,
however the normal use of this signal is as a <em>destination</em> for control data
streams so it should be defined as an <code>input</code> signal.  Note that this
distinction is to help with GUI organization and user-understanding â€“
<em>libmapper</em> enables connections from input signals and to output signals if
desired.</p>

<h3>Creating a signal</h3>

<p>We'll start with creating a "sender", so we will first talk about how to update
output signals.  A signal requires a bit more information than a device, much of
which is optional:</p>

<pre>mapper_signal mapper_device_add_input_signal(mapper_device dev, const char *name,
                                             int length, char type, const char *unit,
                                             void *minimum, void *maximum,
                                             mapper_signal_handler *h,
                                             void *user_data);

mapper_signal mapper_device_add_output_signal(mapper_device dev, const char *name,
                                              int length, char type, const char *unit,
                                              void *minimum, void *maximum);
</pre>

<p>The only <em>required</em> parameters here are the signal "length", its name, and data
type.  Signals are assumed to be vectors of values, so for usual single-valued
signals, a length of 1 should be specified.  Finally, supported types are
currently 'i', 'f', or 'd' (specified as characters in C, not strings), for
<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double</code> values, respectively.</p>

<p>The other parameters are not strictly required, but the more information you
provide, the more the mapper can do some things automatically.  For example, if
<code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> are provided, it will be possible to create
linear-scaled connections very quickly.  If <code>unit</code> is provided, the mapper will
be able to similarly figure out a linear scaling based on unit conversion (from
centimeters to inches for example). Currently automatic unit-based scaling is
not a supported feature, but will be added in the future.  You can take
advantage of this future development by simply providing unit information
whenever it is available.  It is also helpful documentation for users.</p>

<p>Notice that optional values are provided as <code>void*</code> pointers.  This is because a
signal can either be <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>double</code>, and your maximum and minimum
values should correspond in type.  So you should pass in a <code>int*</code>, <code>float*</code>, or
<code>double*</code> by taking the address of a local variable.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is usually necessary to be informed when input signal values change.
This is done by providing a function to be called whenever its value is modified
by an incoming message.  It is passed in the <code>handler</code> parameter, with context
information to be passed to that function during callback in <code>user_data</code>.</p>

<p>An example of creating a "barebones" <code>int</code> scalar output signal with no unit,
minimum, or maximum information:</p>

<pre>mapper_signal outA = mapper_device_add_output_signal(dev, "outA", 1,
                                                     'i', 0, 0, 0);
</pre>

<p>An example of a <code>float</code> signal where some more information is provided:</p>

<pre>float min = 0.0f;
float max = 5.0f;
mapper_signal s1 = mapper_device_add_output_signal(dev, "sensor1", 1, 'f',
"V", &amp;min, &amp;max);
</pre>

<p>So far we know how to create a device and to specify an output signal for it.
To recap, let's review the code so far:</p>

<pre>mapper_device dev = mapper_device_new("my_device", 0, 0);
mapper_signal s1 = mapper_device_add_output_signal(dev, "sensor1", 1, 'f',
                                                   "V", &amp;min, &amp;max);

while (!done) {
    mapper_device_poll(dev, 50);
    ... do stuff ...
    ... update signals ...
}

mapper_device_free(dev);
</pre>

<p>Note that although you have a pointer to the mapper_signal structure (which was
returned by <code>mapper_device_add_output_signal()</code>), its memory is "owned" by the
device.  In other words, you should not worry about freeing its memory - this
will happen automatically when the device is destroyed.  It is possible to
retrieve a device's inputs or outputs by name or by index at a later time using
the functions <code>mapper_device_signal_by_&lt;name/index&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Updating signals</h3>

<p>We can imagine the above program getting sensor information in a loop.  It could
be running on an network-enable ARM device and reading the ADC register
directly, or it could be running on a computer and reading data from an Arduino
over a USB serial port, or it could just be a mouse-controlled GUI slider.
However it's getting the data, it must provide it to <em>libmapper</em> so that it will
be sent to other devices if that signal is mapped.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by the function <code>mapper_signal_update()</code>:</p>

<pre>void mapper_signal_update(mapper_signal sig, void *value,
                          int count, mapper_timetag_t timetag);
</pre>

<p>As you can see, a <code>void*</code> pointer must be provided.  This must point to a data
structure identified by the signal's <code>length</code> and <code>type</code>.  In other words, if
the signal is a 10-vector of <code>int</code>, then <code>value</code> should point to the first item
in a C array of 10 <code>int</code>s.  If it is a scalar <code>float</code>, it should be provided
with the address of a <code>float</code> variable. The <code>count</code> argument allows you to
specify the number of value samples that are being updated - for now we will
set this to 1.  Lastly the <code>timetag</code> argument allows you to specify a time
associated with the signal update. If your value update was generated locally,
or if your program does not have access to upstream timing information (e.g.,
from a microcontroller sampling sensor values), you can use the macro
<code>MAPPER_NOW</code> and libmapper will tag the update with the current time.</p>

<p>To simplify things even further, a short-hand is provided for scalar signals of
particular types:</p>

<pre>void mapper_signal_update_int(mapper_signal sig, int value);
void mapper_signal_update_float(mapper_signal sig, float value);
</pre>

<p>So in the "sensor 1" example, assuming in <code>do_stuff</code> we have some code which
reads sensor 1's value into a float variable called <code>v1</code>, the loop becomes:</p>

<pre>while (!done) {
    mapper_device_poll(my_device, 50);

    // call hypothetical user function that reads a sensor
    float v1 = do_stuff();
    mapper_signal_update_float(sensor1, v1);
}
</pre>

<p>This is about all that is needed to expose sensor 1's value to the network as a
mappable parameter.  The <em>libmapper</em> GUI can now map this value to a receiver,
where it could control a synthesizer parameter or change the brightness of an
LED, or whatever else you want to do.</p>

<h3>Signal conditioning</h3>

<p>Most synthesizers of course will not know what to do with the value of sensor1
--it is an electrical property that has nothing to do with sound or music.  This
is where <em>libmapper</em> really becomes useful.</p>

<p>Scaling or other signal conditioning can be taken care of <em>before</em> exposing the
signal, or it can be performed as part of the mapping.  Since the end user can
demand any mathematical operation be performed on the signal, he can perform
whatever mappings between signals as he wishes.</p>

<p>As a developer, it is therefore your job to provide information that will be
useful to the end user.</p>

<p>For example, if sensor 1 is a position sensor, instead of publishing "voltage",
you could convert it to centimeters or meters based on the known dimensions of
the sensor, and publish a "sensor1/position" signal instead, providing the unit information as well.</p>

<p>We call such signals "semantic", because they provide information with more
meaning than a relatively uninformative value based on the electrical properties
of the sensing technqiue.  Some sensors can benefit from low-pass filtering or
other measures to reduce noise.  Some sensors may need to be combined in order
to derive physical meaning.  What you choose to expose as outputs of your device
is entirely application-dependent.</p>

<p>Best of all, you can publish both "sensor1/position" and "sensor1/voltage" if
desired, in order to expose both processed and raw data.  Keep in mind that
these will not take up significant processing time, and <em>zero</em> network
bandwidth, if they are not mapped.</p>

<h3>Receiving signals</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to create a sender, it would be useful to also know how to
receive signals, so that we can create a sender-receiver pair to test out the
provided mapping functionality. The current value and timestamp for a signal can
be retrieved at any time by calling <code>mapper_signal_value()</code>, however for
event-driven applications you may want to be informed of new values as they are
received or generated.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <code>mapper_device_add_input_signal()</code> function takes an
optional <code>handler</code> and <code>user_data</code>.  This is a function that will be called
whenever the value of that signal changes.  To create a receiver for a
synthesizer parameter "pulse width" (given as a ratio between 0 and 1), specify
a handler when calling <code>mapper_device_add_input_signal()</code>.  We'll imagine there
is some C++ synthesizer implemented as a class <code>Synthesizer</code> which has functions
<code>setPulseWidth()</code> which sets the pulse width in a thread-safe manner, and
<code>startAudioInBackground()</code> which sets up the audio thread.</p>

<p>Create the handler function, which is fairly simple,</p>

<pre>void pulsewidth_handler(mapper_signal sig, mapper_id instance, void *value,
                        int count, mapper_timetag_t *tt) {
    Synthesizer *s = (Synthesizer*) props-&gt;user_data;
    s-&gt;setPulseWidth(*(float*)v);
}
</pre>

<p>First, the pointer to the <code>Synthesizer</code> instance is extracted from the
<code>user_data</code> pointer, then it is dereferenced to set the pulse width according to
the value pointed to by <code>v</code>.</p>

<p>Then <code>main()</code> will look like,</p>

<pre>void main()
{
    Synthesizer synth;
    synth.startAudioInBackground();

    float min = 0.0f;
    float max = 1.0f;

    mapper_device synth_dev = mapper_device_new("synth", 0, 0);
    mapper_signal pw = mapper_device_add_input_signal(synth_dev, "pulsewidth",
                                                      1, 'f', 0, &amp;min, &amp;max,
                                                      pulsewidth_handler, &amp;synth);

    while (!done)
        mapper_device_poll(synth_dev, 50);

    mapper_device_free(synth_dev);
}
</pre>

<h2>Working with timetags</h2>

<p><em>libmapper</em> uses the <code>mapper_timetag_t</code> data structure to store
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#NTP_timestamps">NTP timestamps</a>.
For example, the handler function called when a signal update is received
contains a <code>timetag</code> argument.  This argument indicates the time at which the
source signal was <em>sampled</em> (in the case of sensor signals) or <em>generated</em> (in
the case of sequenced or algorithimically-generated signals).</p>

<p>When updating output signals, using the functions <code>mapper_signal_update_int()</code>
or <code>mapper_signal_update_float()</code> will automatically label the outgoing signal
update with the current time. In cases where the update should more properly be
labeled with another time, this can be accomplished with the function
<code>mapper_signal_update()</code>.  This timestamp should only be overridden if your
program has access to a more accurate measurement of the real time associated
with the signal update, for example if you are writing a driver for an outboard
sensor system that provides the sampling time.  Otherwise the constant
<code>MAPPER_NOW</code> can be used as the timetag argument to cause libmapper to provide
the current time.</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides helper functions for getting the current device-time,
setting the value of a <code>mapper_timetag_t</code> from other representations, and
comparing or copying timetags.  Check the API documentation for more information.</p>

<h2>Working with signal instances</h2>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides support for signals with multiple <em>instances</em>, for
example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>control parameters for polyphonic synthesizers;</li>
    <li>touches tracked by a multitouch surface;</li>
    <li>"blobs" identified by computer vision systems;</li>
    <li>objects on a tabletop tangible user interface;</li>
    <li><em>temporal</em> objects such as gestures or trajectories.</li>
</ul>


<p>The important qualities of signal instances in <em>libmapper</em> are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>instances are interchangeable</strong>: if there are semantics attached to a
        specific instance it should be represented with separate signals instead.</li>
    <li><strong>instances can be ephemeral</strong>: signal instances can be dynamically created
        and destroyed. <em>libmapper</em> will ensure that linked devices share a common
        understanding of the relatonships between instances when they are mapped.</li>
    <li><strong>map once for all instances</strong>: one mapping connection serves to map all of
        its instances.</li>
</ul>


<p>All signals possess one instance by default. If you would like to reserve more
instances you can use:</p>

<pre>mapper_signal_reserve_instances(mapper_signal sig, int num, mapper_id *ids,
                                void **user_data);
</pre>

<p>If the <code>ids</code> argument is null libmapper will automatically assign unique ids to
the reserved instances.</p>

<p>After reserving instances you can update a specific instance:</p>

<pre>mapper_signal_instance_update(mapper_signal sig, mapper_id instance,
                              void *value, int count,
                              mapper_timetag_t timetag);
</pre>

<p>All of the arguments except one should be familiar from the documentation of
<code>mapper_signal_update()</code> presented earlier. The <code>instance</code> argument does not
have to be considered as an array index - it can be any integer that is
convenient for labelling your instance. <em>libmapper</em> will internally create a map
from your id label to one of the preallocated instance structures.</p>

<h3>Receiving instances</h3>

<p>You might have noticed earlier that the handler function called when a signal
update is received has a argument called <code>instance</code>. Here is the function
prototype again:</p>

<pre>void mapper_signal_update_handler(mapper_signal sig, mapper_id instance,
                                  const void *value, int count,
                                  mapper_timetag_t *tt);
</pre>

<p>Under normal usage, this argument will have a value (0 &lt;= n &lt;= num_instances)
and can be used as an array index. Remember that you will need to reserve
instances for your input signal using <code>mapper_signal_reserve_instances()</code> if you
want to receive instance updates.</p>

<h3>Instance Stealing</h3>

<p>For handling cases in which the sender signal has more instances than the
receiver signal, the <em>instance allocation mode</em> can be set for an input signal
to set an action to take in case all allocated instances are in use and a
previously unseen instance id is received. Use the function:</p>

<pre>void mapper_signal_set_instance_stealing_mode(mapper_signal sig,
                                              mapper_instance_stealing_type mode);
</pre>

<p>The argument <code>mode</code> can have one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>MAPPER_NO_STEALING</code> Default value, in which no stealing of instances will
        occur;</li>
    <li><code>MAPPER_STEAL_OLDEST</code> Release the oldest active instance and reallocate its
        resources to the new instance;</li>
    <li><code>MAPPER_STEAL_NEWEST</code> Release the newest active instance and reallocate its
        resources to the new instance;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to use another method for determining which active instance to
release (e.g. the sound with the lowest volume), you can create an
<code>instance_event_handler</code> for the signal and write the method yourself:</p>

<pre>void my_handler(mapper_signal sig, mapper_id instance,
                mapper_instance_event event, mapper_timetag_t *tt) {
    // hypothetical user code chooses which instance to release
    mapper_id release_me = choose_instance_to_release(sig);

    mapper_signal_release_instance(sig, release_me, *tt);

    // now an instance is available
}

<p>For this function to be called when instance stealing is necessary, we need to
register it for <code>MAPPER_INSTANCE_OVERFLOW</code> events:</p>

<pre>mapper_signal_set_instance_event_callback(sig, my_handler,
                                          MAPPER_INSTANCE_OVERFLOW);
</pre>

<h2>Publishing metadata</h2>

<p>Things like device names, signal units, and ranges, are examples of metadata
--information about the data you are exposing on the network.</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides the ability to specify arbitrary extra metadata in the
form of name-value pairs.  These are not interpreted by <em>libmapper</em> in any way,
but can be retrieved over the network.  This can be used for instance to give a
device X and Y information, or to perhaps give a signal some property like
"reliability", or some category like "light", "motor", "shaker", etc.</p>

<p>Some GUI could then use this information to display information about the network
in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>Any time there may be extra knowledge about a signal or device, it is a good
idea to represent it by adding such properties, which can be of any
OSC-compatible type.  (So, numbers and strings, etc.)</p>

<p>The property interface is through the functions,</p>

<pre>void mapper_device_set_property(mapper_device dev, const char *property,
                                int length, char type, void *value);

void mapper_signal_set_property(mapper_signal sig, const char *property,
                                int length, char type, void *value);

void mapper_link_set_property(mapper_link lnk, const char *property,
                              int length, char type, void *value);

void mapper_map_set_property(mapper_map map, const char *property,
                             int length, char type, void *value);
</pre>

<p>The type of the <code>value</code> argument is specified by <code>type</code>: floats are <code>'f'</code>,
32-bit integers are <code>'i'</code>, doubles are <code>'d'</code>, and strings are <code>'s'</code>.</p>

<p>For example, to store a <code>float</code> indicating the X position of a device, you can
call it like this:</p>

<pre>float x = 12.5;
mapper_device_set_property(my_device, "x", 'f', &amp;x);

char *sensingMethod = "resistive";
mapper_signal_set_property(sensor1, "sensingMethod",
                           's', sensingMethod);
</pre>

<p>If the parent object (a device and a signal in this case) is <em>local</em> the property
change takes place immediately. If the object is <em>remote</em> the property change is only
staged and must be pushed out to the network using the functions <code>&lt;object_name&gt;_push()</code>:</p>

<pre>mapper_device_push(mapper_device dev);
mapper_signal_push(mapper_signal sig);
mapper_link_push(mapper_link lnk);
mapper_map_push(mapper_map mpa);
</pre>
