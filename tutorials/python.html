<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Since <em>libmapper</em> uses GNU autoconf, getting started with the library
is the same as any other library on Linux; use <code>./configure</code> and then
<code>make</code> to compile it.  You'll need <code>swig</code> available if you want to
compile the Python bindings.  On Mac OS X, we provide a precompiled
Framework bundle for 32- and 64-bit Intel platforms, so using it with
XCode should be a matter of including it in your project.</p>

<p>Once you have libmapper installed, it can be imported into your program:</p>

<pre><code>import mapper
</code></pre>

<h3>Overview of the API organization</h3>

<p>The libmapper API is is divided into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signals</li>
<li>Devices</li>
<li>Admins</li>
<li>Device database</li>
<li>Signal database</li>
<li>Connections database</li>
<li>Links database</li>
<li>Monitors</li>
</ul>


<p>For this tutorial, the only sections to pay attention to are Devices
and Signals.  Admins is reserved for providing custom networking
configurations, but in general you don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>Monitor and the various database modules are used to keep track of
what devices, signals and connections are on the network.  Devices do
not need to worry about this.  It is used mainly for creating user
interfaces for mapping design and will also not be covered here.</p>

<h3>Devices</h3>

<h4>Creating a device</h4>

<p>To create a <em>libmapper</em> device, it is necessary to provide a device
name to the constructor.  There is an initialization period after a
device is created where a unique ordinal is chosen to append to the
device name.  This allows multiple devices with the same name to
exist on the network.</p>

<p>If no other arguments are given, libmapper will randomly choose a port
to use for exchanging signal data.  If desired, a second argument setting
a specific "starting port" can be given, but the allocation algorithm will
possibly choose another port number close to it if the port is in use.</p>

<p>A third optional parameter of the constructor is an admin object.  It is
not necessary to provide this, but can be used to specify different
networking parameters, such as specifying the name of the network
interface to use.</p>

<p>An example of creating a device:</p>

<pre><code>dev = mapper.device( "mydevice" )
</code></pre>

<h4>Polling the device</h4>

<p>The device lifecycle looks like this, in terrible ASCII diagram art:</p>

<pre><code>creation --&gt; poll --+--&gt; destruction
              |     |
              +--&lt;--+
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, after a device is created, it must be continuously
polled during its lifetime.</p>

<p>The polling is necessary for several reasons: to respond to requests
on the admin bus; to check for incoming signals; to update outgoing
signals.  Therefore even a device that does not have signals must be
polled.  The user program must organize to have a timer or idle
handler which can poll the device often enough.  The polling interval is
not extremely sensitive, but should be 100 ms or less.  The more often
it is polled, the faster it can handle incoming and outgoing
signals.</p>

<p>The <code>poll</code> function can be blocking or non-blocking, depending on
how you want your application to behave.  It takes a number of
milliseconds during which it should do some work, or 0 if it should
check for any immediate actions and then return without waiting:</p>

<pre><code>int count = dev.poll( int block_ms )
</code></pre>

<p>An example of calling it with non-blocking behaviour:</p>

<pre><code>dev.poll( 0 );
</code></pre>

<p>If your polling is in the middle of a processing function or in
response to a GUI event for example, non-blocking behaviour is
desired.  On the other hand if you put it in the middle of a loop
which reads incoming data at intervals or steps through a simulation
for example, you can use <code>poll()</code> as your "sleep" function, so that
it will react to network activity while waiting.</p>

<p>It returns the number of messages handled, so optionally you could
continue to call it until there are no more messages waiting.  Of
course, you should be careful doing that without limiting the time it
will loop for, since if the incoming stream is fast enough you might
never get anything else done!</p>

<p>Note that an important difference between blocking and non-blocking
polling is that during the blocking period, messages will be handled
immediately as they are received.  On the other hand, if you use your
own sleep, messages will be queued up until you can call <code>poll()</code>;
stated differently, it will "time-quantize" the message handling.
This is not necessarily bad, but you should be aware of this effect.</p>

<p>Since there is a delay before the device is completely initialized, it
is sometimes useful to be able to determine this using <code>ready()</code>.
Only when <code>ready()</code> returns non-zero is it valid to use the
device's name.</p>

<h3>Signals</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to create a device and poll it, we only
need to know how to add signals in order to give our program some
input/output functionality.</p>

<p>We'll start with creating a "sender", so we will first talk about how
to update output signals.</p>

<h4>Creating a signal</h4>

<p>A signal requires a bit more information than a device, much of which
is optional:</p>

<ul>
<li>a name for the signal (must be unique within a devices inputs or outputs)</li>
<li>the signal's vector length</li>
<li>the signal's data type expressed as a character 'i', 'f', 'd'</li>
<li>the signal's unit (optional)</li>
<li>the signal's minimum value (optional)</li>
<li>the signal's maximum value (optional)</li>
</ul>


<p>for input signals there is an additional argument:</p>

<ul>
<li>a function to be called when the signal is updated</li>
</ul>


<p>examples:</p>

<pre><code>sig_in = dev.add_input( "/my_input", 1, 'f', "m/s", -10, 10, h )</code></pre>

<pre><code>sig_out = dev.add_output( "/my_output", 4, 'i', None, 0, 1000 )</code></pre>

<p>The only <em>required</em> parameters here are the signal "length", its name,
and data type.  Signals are assumed to be vectors of values, so for
usual single-valued signals, a length of 1 should be specified.  A
signal name should start with "/", as this is how it is represented in
the OSC address.  (One will be added if you forget to do this.)
Finally, supported types are currently 'i' or 'f' for <code>int</code> or
<code>float</code> values, respectively.</p>

<p>The other parameters are not strictly required, but the more
information you provide, the more the mapper can do some things
automatically.  For example, if <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> are provided,
it will be possible to create linear-scaled connections very quickly.
If <code>unit</code> is provided, the mapper will be able to similarly figure out
a linear scaling based on unit conversion. (Centimeters to inches for
example.)^[Currently automatic unit-based scaling is not a supported
feature, but will be added in the future.  You can take advantage of
this future development by simply providing unit information whenever
it is available.  It is also helpful documentation for users.]</p>

<p>Lastly, it is usually necessary to be informed when input signal
values change.  This is done by providing a function to be called
whenever its value is modified by an incoming message.  It is passed
in the <code>handler</code> parameter.</p>

<p>An example of creating a "barebones" <code>int</code> scalar output signal with
no unit, minimum, or maximum information:</p>

<pre><code>outA = dev.add_output( "/outA", 1, 'i', None, None, None );
</code></pre>

<p>or omitting some arguments:</p>

<pre><code>outA = dev.add_output( "/outA", 1, 'i' );
</code></pre>

<p>An example of a <code>float</code> signal where some more information is provided:</p>

<pre><code>sensor1_voltage = dev.add_output( "/sensor1", 1, 'f', "V", 0.0, 5.0 )
</code></pre>

<p>So far we know how to create a device and to specify an output signal
for it.  To recap, let's review the code so far:</p>

<pre><code>import mapper

dev = mapper.device( "test_sender" )
sensor1_voltage = dev.add_output( "/sensor1", 1, 'f', "V", 0.0, 5.0 )

while 1:
    dev.poll( 50 )
    ... do stuff ...
    ... update signals ...
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to retrieve a device's inputs or outputs by name or by
index at a later time using the functions
<code>get_&lt;input/output&gt;_by_&lt;name/index&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4>Updating signals</h4>

<p>We can imagine the above program getting sensor information in a loop.
It could be running on an network-enabled ARM device and reading the
ADC register directly, or it could be running on a computer and
reading data from an Arduino over a USB serial port, or it could just
be a mouse-controlled GUI slider.  However it's getting the data, it
must provide it to <em>libmapper</em> so that it will be sent to other
devices if that signal is mapped.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by the <code>update</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sig&gt;.update( &lt;value&gt; )
</code></pre>

<p>So in the "sensor 1 voltage" example, assuming in "do stuff" we have
some code which reads sensor 1's value into a float variable called
<code>v1</code>, the loop becomes:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
    dev.poll( 50 )
    v1 = read_sensor_1()
    sensor1_voltage.update( v1 )
</code></pre>

<p>This is about all that is needed to expose sensor 1's voltage to the
network as a mappable parameter.  The <em>libmapper</em> GUI can now be used
to create a mapping between this value and a receiver, where it could
control a synthesizer parameter or change the brightness of an LED,
or whatever else you want to do.</p>

<h4>Signal conditioning</h4>

<p>Most synthesizers of course will not know what to do with
"voltage"--it is an electrical property that has nothing to do with
sound or music.  This is where <em>libmapper</em> really becomes useful.</p>

<p>Scaling or other signal conditioning can be taken care of <em>before</em>
exposing the signal, or it can be performed as part of the mapping.
Since the end user can demand any mathematical operation be performed
on the signal, he can perform whatever mappings between signals as he
wishes.</p>

<p>As a developer, it is therefore your job to provide information that
will be useful to the end user.</p>

<p>For example, if sensor 1 is a position sensor, instead of publishing
"voltage", you could convert it to centimeters or meters based on the
known dimensions of the sensor, and publish a "/sensor1/position"
signal instead, providing the unit information as well.</p>

<p>We call such signals "semantic", because they provide information with
more meaning than a relatively uninformative value based on the
electrical properties of the sensing technique.  Some sensors can
benefit from low-pass filtering or other measures to reduce noise.
Some sensor data may need to be combined in order to derive physical
meaning.  What you choose to expose as outputs of your device is
entirely application-dependent.</p>

<p>You can even publish both "/sensor1/position" and "/sensor1/voltage"
if desired, in order to expose both processed and raw data.  Keep in
mind that these will not take up significant processing time, and
<em>zero</em> network bandwidth, if they are not mapped.</p>

<h4>Receiving signals</h4>

<p>Now that we know how to create a sender, it would be useful to also
know how to receive signals, so that we can create a sender-receiver
pair to test out the provided mapping functionality.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <code>add_input</code> function takes an optional
<code>handler</code>.  This is a function that will be called whenever the value
of that signal changes.  To create a receiver for a synthesizer
parameter "pulse width" (given as a ratio between 0 and 1), specify
a handler when calling <code>add_input</code>.  We'll imagine there is some
python synthesizer implemented as a class <code>synthesizer</code> which has
functions <code>setPulseWidth()</code> which sets the pulse width in a
thread-safe manner, and <code>startAudioInBackground()</code> which sets up the
audio thread.</p>

<p>Let's use a real-world example using the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyo/">pyo DSP library for Python</a> to create a
simple synth consisting of one sine wave. For now, we will only worry
about controlling one parameter: the frequency of the sine.</p>

<p>We need to create a handler function for libmapper to update the pyo synth:</p>

<pre><code>def frequency_handler(sig, id, f, timetag):
    try:
        a.setFreq( f )
    except:
        print 'exception'
        print sig, f
</code></pre>

<p>Then our program will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>from pyo import *
import mapper

# Some pyo stuff
synth = Server().boot().start()
a = Sine( freq=200, mul=0.5 )
out = a()

def freq_handler (sig, id, f, timetag):
    try:
        a.setFreq( f )
    except:
        print 'exception'
        print sig, f

dev = mapper.device( "pyo_example" )
dev.add_input( "freq", 1, 'f', "Hz", 20, 2000, freq_handler )

while 1:
    dev.poll( 100 )
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately, we can simplify our code by using a <code>lambda function</code>
instead of a separate handler:</p>

<pre><code>from pyo import *
import mapper

# Some pyo stuff
synth = Server().boot().start()
sine = Sine( freq=200, mul=0.5 )
out = sine.out()

dev = mapper.device( "pyo_example" )
dev.add_input( "freq", 1, 'f', "Hz", 20, 2000, lambda s, i, f, t: sine.setFreq(f) )

while 1:
    dev.poll( 100 )
</code></pre>

<h3>Publishing metadata</h3>

<p>Things like device names, signal units, and ranges, are examples of
metadata--information about the data you are exposing on the network.</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides the ability to specify arbitrary extra
metadata in the form of name-value pairs.  These are not interpreted
by <em>libmapper</em> in any way, but can be retrieved over the network.
This can be used for instance to label a device with its loation, or
to perhaps give a signal some property like "reliability", or some
category like "light", "motor", "shaker", etc.</p>

<p>Some GUI implementing a Monitor could then use this information to
display information about the network in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>Any time there may be extra knowledge about a signal or device, it is
a good idea to represent it by adding such properties, which can be of
any OSC-compatible type.  (So, numbers and strings, etc.)</p>

<p>The property interface is through the functions,</p>

<pre><code>set_property( key, value )
</code></pre>

<p>where the value can any OSC-compatible type. This function can be called
for devices or signals.</p>

<p>For example, to store a <code>float</code> indicating the X position of a device
<code>dev</code>, you can call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>dev.set_property( "x", 12.5 )
</code></pre>

<p>To specify a string property of a signal:</p>

<pre><code>sig.set_property( "sensingMethod", "resistive" )
</code></pre>

<p>In general you can use any property name not already in use by the
device or signal data structure.  Reserved words for signals are:</p>

<pre><code>device_name, direction, length, max, min, name, type, unit, user_data
</code></pre>

<p>for devices, they are:</p>

<pre><code>host, port, name, user_data
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you query or set signal properties using these
keywords, you will get or modify the same information that is
available directly from the <code>signal</code> data structure.
Therefore this can provide a unified string-based method for accessing
any signal property:</p>

<pre><code>props = sig.get_properties()
sensingMethod = props['sensingMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>Primarily this is an interface meant for network monitors, but may
come in useful for an application implementing a device.</p>
